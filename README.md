# Interpretable Continuous Early Classification (ICEC)

This repository contains the source code for our paper *From Numeric to Label: An Interpretable Continuous Early Classification for Multi-label Sequence*, submitted at **KDD, 2025**.

The key idea of our method is to build similarity associations by a contract mechanism using less construction cost to improve the efficiency of each classification under exactly-once and partial observation. We find the key labels by attention mechanism to provide a transparent decision-making process and quantified labels, and we reduce the additional overhead from it. In this work, we alleviate the lack of labeled data by co-training and evaluating classifiers with these key labels to improve accuracy.
